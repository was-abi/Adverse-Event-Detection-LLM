# Adverse-Event-Detection-LLM
Goal: “Build a real-time pipeline that uses LLMs (like Gemini 2.5 Flash) to extract relevant details from clinical notes and combines these with structured EHR data to predict or flag potential adverse medical events.”

Motivation: Early detection is critical; doctors log most relevant info as text.

Success Metric: E.g., “High recall for critical events, reasonable API latency.”
